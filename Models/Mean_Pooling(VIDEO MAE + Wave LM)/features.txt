- Mean Pooling
- No early stopping
- Validation metrics - mean absolute error, quadratic weighted κ, overall accuracy, Spearman’s ρ, and expected calibration error

- 16 frames - uniformly distanced
- Data Augmentation to get exact 5 video clips for each video
= Normal 5 fold cross validation
- 1 Layer in MLP (1536 - 512 - 3) with a dropout of 0.3



THE FINAL METRICS ARE:-
[cv] Summary (mean ± std):
    MAE: 0.177 ± 0.053
    QWK: 0.860 ± 0.040
    ACC: 0.823 ± 0.053
    RHO: 0.872 ± 0.048
    ECE: 0.209 ± 0.043

[done] Pipeline execution complete.
