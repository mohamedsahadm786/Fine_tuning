- Attention Pooling
- Early stopping (patience = 3)
- Validation metrics - mean absolute error, quadratic weighted κ, overall accuracy, Spearman’s ρ, expected calibration error, F1 (Macro), BAL (Balanced Accuracy) + Fold-Logit Ensemble (with Per-Fold T) for Inference

- 16 frames - uniformly distanced
- No Data Augmentation + remove clips with <10 second if the number of clips >5 
= Group K fold cross validation
- 1 Layer in MLP (1536 - 512 - 3) with a dropout of 0.3



THE FINAL METRICS ARE:-
